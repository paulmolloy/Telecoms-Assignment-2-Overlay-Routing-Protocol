# Telecoms-Assignment-2-Overlay-Routing-Protocol
"Internet of Fridges" An Overlay Routing Protocol for ADSL routers that allows communication between users associated with the ADSL routers.

To run either the Distance-Vector or Link State implementation run the corresponding client class. To send a message type [sendingUser]:[receivingUser]:[message] into the console e.g. Able:Dillon:Hello how are you?. To send an image or other file type FILE:[sendingUser]:[receivingUser]:[FileName] e.g. FILE:Able:Dillon:file.png.
Whenever the program is run it opens a terminal window for each router and logging of what each router does can be seen e.g. passing on a packet to another router and where it came from and is being sent on to next or receiving a packet set to it.
